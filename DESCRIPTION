Description: This package implements a version of the cocktail algorithm to calculate D-, Ds-, A- and I-optimal designs for non-linear models. It allows to compare designs via their efficiency, and D-augment any design with a controlled efficiency. An efficient rounding function has been provided to transform approximate to exact designs.
